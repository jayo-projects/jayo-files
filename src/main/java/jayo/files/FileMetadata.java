/**
 * Description of a file referenced by a path.
 * <p>
 * In simple use a file system is a mechanism for organizing files and directories on a local storage device. In
 * practice file systems are more capable and their contents more varied. For example, a path may refer to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An operating system process that consumes data, produces data, or both. For example, reading from the
 * {@code /dev/urandom} file on Linux returns a unique sequence of pseudorandom bytes to each reader.
 * <li>A stream that connects a pair of programs together. A pipe is a special file that a producing program writes to
 * and a consuming program reads from. Both programs operate concurrently. The size of a pipe is not well-defined: the
 * writer can write as much data as the reader is able to read.
 * <li>A file on a remote file system. The performance and availability of remote files may be quite different from that
 * of local files!
 * <li>A symbolic link (symlink) to another file. When attempting to access this path the file system will follow the
 * link and return data from the target path.
 * <li>The same content as another path without a symlink. On UNIX file systems an inode is an anonymous handle to a
 * file's content, and multiple paths may target the same inode without any other relationship to one another. A
 * consequence of this design is that a directory with three 1 GiB files may only need 1 GiB on the storage device.
 * </ul>
 * This class does not attempt to model these rich file system features! It exposes a limited view useful for programs
 * with only basic file system needs. Be cautious of the potential consequences of special files when writing programs
 * that operate on a file system.
 * <p>
 * File metadata is subject to change, and code that operates on file systems should defend against changes to the file
 * that occur between reading metadata and subsequent operations.
